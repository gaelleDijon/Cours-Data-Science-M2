# Airbnb Price Prediction Project

## Objective

The goal of this project is to apply **data exploration** and **supervised machine learning techniques** to predict the **logarithm of Airbnb prices** based on listing features. Students will learn how to:

- Explore and visualize complex datasets
- Perform data cleaning and feature engineering
- Train, evaluate, and compare ML models
- Generate predictions for a hidden test set

---

## Project Deliverables

1. **Jupyter Notebook** (`airbnb_project.ipynb`) containing:

   - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
   - Preprocessing and feature engineering steps
   - Model training and evaluation
   - Visualizations and markdown explanations

2. **Prediction File** (`prediction.csv`) containing:

   - Two columns: `id` and `prediction`
   - Format should match `prediction_example.csv`

## 👥 Team

- Max **2 students per group**

## Project Structure

### 1. 🔍 Data Exploration (≈ 1/3 of the time)

- Present dataset structure (features, types, distributions)
- Highlight missing values, outliers, distributions, and correlations
- Include rich visualizations (histograms, heatmaps, maps if relevant)
- Justify preprocessing/feature selection based on exploration

### 2. Prediction (≈ 2/3 of the time)

- Experiment with different preprocessing pipelines:

  - Encoding
  - Scaling/normalization
  - Feature engineering

- Try multiple ML models:

  - Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, etc.

- Perform rigorous model evaluation:

  - Train/test split, cross-validation
  - Define a baseline model
  - Compare models with clear metrics (e.g., RMSE)

---

## Notebook Requirements

- **Clear structure** with:

  - Markdown explanations
  - Comments in code
  - Visualizations of key steps and results

- **Readable and pedagogical**: A good notebook > high score with unreadable code
- **Prediction file** must follow the required format exactly

---

## Evaluation Criteria

### ✔️ 1/3 of the grade: **Data Exploration**

- Clarity and completeness of dataset presentation
- Relevance and aesthetics of visualizations
- Insights and hypotheses generated

### ✔️ 2/3 of the grade: **Prediction**

- Diversity and creativity in feature engineering
- Variety of models tested
- Evaluation rigor and baseline comparison
- Result analysis and justifications

> 🔔 **Tip**: A well-structured and explained notebook with moderate performance is **preferred** over an unclear one with a high score.
